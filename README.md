# auths
Implementation of Devise and Pundit for Authentication and Authorization, along with Pagy for Pagination.


This is not a Functional App, it is just to show how CanCanCan and Devise can be combined to implement Authentication and Authorization in your application. I have given the deletion rights to Admin, Creation Rights to a Signed_in User, can viewing rights to a user who hasen't signed in.
